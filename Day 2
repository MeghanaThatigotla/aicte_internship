1.Program to swap two number using bitwise operator.
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
     int a = 15,b = 24;
     printf("value of a=%d and b=%d before swapping");
     a =a^b;
     b =a^b;
     a =a^b;
     printf("value of a=%d and b=%d after swapping");
     return 0;
}

output:
 values of a and b before swapping a = 15 b = 24
 values of a and b after swapping a = 24 b = 15
